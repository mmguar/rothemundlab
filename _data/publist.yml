  description: We show that we can position DNA origami on silica surfaces with absolute (all degrees of freedom are specified) and arbitrary (every molecule's orientation is independently specified).

- title: "Programmable molecular recognition based on the geometry of DNA nanostructures"
  image: programmable_molecular.png
  description: We show that we can create geometric arrangements of DNA nanostructures not by using the well-known Waston-Crick complementarity, but by exploiting blunt-end stacking interactions. The DNA origami are designed to have orthogonal binding rules and can assemble in desired larger shapes.
