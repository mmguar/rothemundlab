# Research   
## DNA origami
For an introduction to DNA origami and our research, watch the Watson Lecture on "DNA origami: Folded DNA as a Building Material for Molecular Devices":

## Current projects  

### Biosensing with DNA origami  

We are devising new sensors that can perform DNA and protein detection by using DNA origami as the sensing element. This allows us to tune and optimize the geometry of the sensor in order to accommodate a wide range of analytes and design the structure to optimize signal gain. Electrochemically active molecules can be incorporated in such a device and enable electrical transduction, creating a single-molecule sensing chip that could be used in-vivo and connected to electronics, giving the user a final readout value.

# Not only us

Importantly, there is a long list of people who do work on DNA nanotechnology. Among them the inventor of DNA nanotechnology [Ned Seeman](http://seemanlab4.chem.nyu.edu/nanotech.html) at NYU, [William Shih](shih.med.harvard.edu) at Harvard, [Milan Stojanovic and Darko Stefanovic](https://systemsbiology.columbia.edu/faculty/milan-stojanovic) at Columbia and UNM, [Hao Yan](http://yanlab.asu.edu/) at Arizona State University, [Thom LaBean](https://www.mse.ncsu.edu/labean/) at NCSU, [Andrew Turberfield](https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/self-assembled-structures-and-devices) at Oxford, [Hiroshi Sugiyama and Masayuki Endo](http://www.icems.kyoto-u.ac.jp/e/ppl/grp/sugiyama.html) at Kyoto University, [Bernie Yurke](http://coen.boisestate.edu/ece/faculty-staff/bio/?id=2) and [others](http://boisestate.edu/nano/about-us/faculty/) in the [Nanoscale Materials and Devices Lab](http://nano.boisestate.edu/) at Boise State University, [Hendrik Dietz](http://bionano.physik.tu-muenchen.de/), [Fritz Simmel](http://www.e14.ph.tum.de/), and [Tim Liedl](http://www.softmatter.physik.uni-muenchen.de/tiki-index.php?page=GroupLiedlHome) with their three groups in Munich, and many others.
